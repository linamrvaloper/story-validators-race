# Linamr Validator

I am linamr, validator, web 3.0 enthusiast, and DevOps engineer with 2+ years of experience. My main values are reliability, security, responsibility to the community, and usefulness. 

### Security
- I use SSH connections to servers, store all keys encrypted in a secure location, and have configured firewall settings. For emergencies, there are additional servers. If an issue arises on a server that can't be quickly resolved, the node on the current server will be stopped and started on the backup.

### Monitoring
- For server monitoring and alerting, I use Zabbix. Also, I use custom scripts for node monitoring.

### Decentralization
- I choose server locations depending on the project to enhance decentralization.

## Networks I validate in
I've validated in such networks as Namada, Autonity, Uptick, Massa.
